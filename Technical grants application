# Bridging Altmask web extension/wallet with KDA

## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The basic idea is to create a wallet to achieve the bridge between KDA blockchain and Althash blockchain through Altmask web extension which could be downloaded and installed on Chrome.

With this tool, HTMLCOIN users and Althash HRC20 projects will be able to move liquidity from the Althash blockchain onto KDA blockchain and vice versa + any future DeFi projects on KDA and Althash.

The idea for bridging our web extention with KDA for DeFi purposes came from our meetings with Mr. Francesco Melpignano, Dept. of Business Development for KDA. 

>Planned Features for V1.0
>- Show total balance - only show chain balances in specific screen
>- Transfer where user can choose any -> any, chainId -> chainId, any -> chainId 
>- Support all token types (as specified by user)
>- 2-way connection with dapps (secure sessions)

## 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. **Market fit:** With this tool we can develop, distribute and maintain only one project which will be cross platform and agnostic to the OS. In addition will be user friendly and will give the possibility to even less experienced users to interact with the KDA ecosystem.
2. **Current progress:** Currently we are committed on the architectural side of the project. The next step is to prepare mockups starting from the main features. 
3. **Future plans:** Once the project is completed, the plan is to maintain and develop other features based on the market requirements.
